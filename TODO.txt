- Provide 'safety' lock against inadvertent execution of Definer::defineUpdate(...)
  queries against prod dbs.
- Be able to revert migrations with specified regression steps.
- Detect and reject attempts to add migrations to anywhere but the end.
- Lock during migration, to prevent multiple application instances simultaneously migrating.
- Add auto-generated code warning to generated database abstraction layer.
- Add Definer::defineAllTables(boolean includingSystem) to wrap all db tables.
- Add Definer::defineStoredProcedureInvoke(...) to wrap a stored procedure invocation.
- Add Definer::defineAllStoredProcedureInvoke(...) to wrap all stored proc invocations.
- Aim for 100% coverage via unit/e2e tests.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Auto-generate hashCode()/equals() code for generated tuple classes and/or support Java records.
