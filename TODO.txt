- Add queryForUpdate(...) to generated Query subclasses.
- Define 'final String sqlText' at class level in Query and Update subclasses.
- Use Wrapd-demo as basis for more comprehensive unit/e2e tests.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Auto-generate hashCode()/equals() code for generated tuple classes and/or support Java records.
