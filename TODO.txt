- Add optional where clause and parms to defineTable().
- Make insert(...) and update(...) only available on defineTable(...)-generated or ForUpdate Tuple derivatives.
  Only these will need Database instance passed in. Maybe divide into Tuple and UpdatableTuple base classes?
- Add Definer::defineAllTables(boolean includingSystem) to wrap all db tables.
- Add Definer::defineStoredProcedureInvoke(...) to wrap a stored procedure invocation.
- Add Definer::defineAllStoredProcedureInvoke(...) to wrap all stored proc invocations.
- Use Wrapd-demo as basis for more comprehensive unit/e2e tests.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Auto-generate hashCode()/equals() code for generated tuple classes and/or support Java records.
