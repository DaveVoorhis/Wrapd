- Finish code in QueryDefinition::generate to generate a subclass
of Query, named per queryName. The subclasses of Query are later passed
to Database instance for use in applications.
- Create test/resources/Test*_Source02.java source files to test the above,
similar to existing test/java/org.reldb.wrapd.sqldb.*.TestQueries.

- Test ResultSetToTuple.toStream()

- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Consider incorporating ResultSet to Tuple code in each Tuple class, if it's
  more optimal that way.
