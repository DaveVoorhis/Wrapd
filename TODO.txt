- Maybe combine QueryDefinition and UpdateDefinition into one(??)
- Improve QueryDefiner to generate Query derivatives with update(Database db, ...), insert(Database db, ...) in
  addition to existing query(Database db, ...), etc. (Part way there...)
  This may require predefined Query derivatives called Select, Insert, Update and Delete,
  from which the generated ones are derived.
- Use Wrapd-demo as basis for more comprehensive tests, maybe.
- Expose Toolbox dependency via Gradle api directive?
- Implement a quick query definition for 'SELECT * FROM $$x' on a specific table x,
  with an insert(...) on its Tuple definition that doesn't require explictly naming the table.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Auto-generate hashCode()/equals() code for generated tuple classes and/or support Java records.
