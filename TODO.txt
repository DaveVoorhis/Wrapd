- Improve QueryDefiner to generate Query derivatives with update(Database db, ...), insert(Database db, ...) in
  addition to existing query(Database db, ...), etc.
  This may require predefined Query derivatives called Select, Insert, Update and Delete,
  from which the generated ones are derived.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Consider incorporating ResultSet to Tuple code in each Tuple class, if it's
  more optimal that way.
