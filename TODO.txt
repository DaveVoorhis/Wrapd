- Improve parameter names in generated Query derivatives (get from Tuple derivates?)
- Improve QueryDefiner to generate Query derivatives where get(...) has been replaced with run(Database db, ...) or
  (as approprite) select(Database db, ...), update(Database db, ...), insert(Database db, ...) etc. This may
  require predefined Query derivatives called Select, Insert, Update and Delete, from which the generated
  ones are derived.
- Consider making transactional and non-transactional query method names different,
  so it's less likely to mix transactional and non-transactional code by accident.
- Consider incorporating ResultSet to Tuple code in each Tuple class, if it's
  more optimal that way.
