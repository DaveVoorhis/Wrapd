A _SQL amplifier_ makes SQL easier to use, better integrated, better tested, 
more easily migrated and managed than using alternatives like ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) or raw JDBC,
while staying light, lean, and loveable.

Wrapd is for Java 11 and above.

See [https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Wrapd-demo](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Wrapd-demo) for a Wrapd-ly written demo application.

The Wrapd library is hosted at [https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Wrapd](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Wrapd)

*"Wrapd" is pronounced "wrapped", "rapid" and "rapt."*

* SQL access is helpfully *wrapped*, not awkwardly hidden.
* SQL-in-Java development is *rapid*.
* SQL focus can be *rapt*.
